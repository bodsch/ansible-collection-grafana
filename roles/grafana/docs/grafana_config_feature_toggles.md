# `grafana_config_feature_toggles`

> Not implemented yet.
> Needs support!

```yaml
grafana_config_feature_toggles: {}
#   there are currently two ways to enable feature toggles in the `grafana.ini`.
#   you can either pass an array of feature you want to enable to the `enable` field or
#   configure each toggle by setting the name of the toggle to true/false. Toggles set to true/false
#   will take presidence over toggles in the `enable` list.
#   enable: feature1,feature2
#   feature1: true
#   feature2: false
```
